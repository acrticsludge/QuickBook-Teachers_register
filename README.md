# Quick Book the ultimate teachers register.

QuickBook is a simple to use program that will store your students mark record on a local database. This program is in the early stages and will be updated as new features hit my mind.

**Instructions**
1. Create the local database to store your marks. Instructions to create a local database can be found here https://github.com/acrticsludge/SQLITE-Database
2. Create a new package named TeacherRegister and drop all the files in the package.
3. Run Create.java.
4. Run CreateStudentTable.java.
5. Run MarksMain and start using QuickBook!

**You're all set!**
