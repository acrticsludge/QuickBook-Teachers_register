# Quick Book the ultimate teachers register.

QuickBook is a simple to use program that will store your students mark record on a local database. This program is in the early stages and will be updated as new features hit my mind. Wiki coming soon!https://github.com/acrticsludge/QuickBook-Teachers_register/wiki

**Instructions**
1. Create the local database to store your marks. Instructions to create a local database can be found here https://github.com/acrticsludge/SQLITE-Database
2. Create a new package named TeacherRegister and drop all the files in the package.
3. Run Create.java.
4. Run CreateStudentTable.java.
5. Run MarksMain and start using QuickBook!
**You're all set!**

**Planned features:**
1. Multi subject storage.
2. Attendance storage.
3. Percentage calculator (of all or single subject). **DONE!!!!**

# New Branch
A new branch exists which has the following code converted into an executable file. Info here ---> https://github.com/acrticsludge/QuickBook-Teachers_register/tree/jar-main
*releases will be published as I embed the code for a new feature, last edited by acrticsludge on 04/02/2022 at 22:04 PM (10:04 PM).*
