# Quick Book the ultimate teachers register.

QuickBook is a simple to use program that will store your students mark record on a local database. This program is in the early stages and will be updated as new features hit my mind. Wiki coming soon!https://github.com/acrticsludge/QuickBook-Teachers_register/wiki

**Instructions**
1. Download the TeacherRegister.zip file and place it directly in your root directory that is the C drive.
2. unzip the TeacherRegister.zip and place the folder named sqlite in the C drive.
3. Open the sqlite folder and run Teacher.bat file.
**You're all set!**

**Planned features:**
1. Multi subject storage.
2. Attendance storage.
3. Percentage calculator (of all or single subject). https://github.com/acrticsludge/Percentage-calc

*releases will be published as I embed the code for a new feature, last edited by acrticsludge on 16/01/2022 at 16:56 PM (4:56 PM).*
